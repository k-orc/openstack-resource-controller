                  Available represents the availability of the OpenStack resource. If it is

                  Progressing indicates whether the controller is still attempting to
                  reconcile the current state of the OpenStack resource to the desired
                  state. Progressing will be False either because the desired state has
                  been achieved, or because some terminal error prevents it from ever being
                  achieved and the controller is no longer attempting to reconcile. If
                  Progressing is True, an observer waiting on the resource should continue
