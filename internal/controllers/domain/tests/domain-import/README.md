# Import Domain

## Step 00

Import a domain, matching all of the available filter's fields, and verify it is waiting for the external resource to be created.

## Step 01

Create a domain which name is a superstring of the one specified in the import filter, and otherwise matching the filter, and verify that it's not being imported.

## Step 02

Create a domain matching the filter and verify that the observed status on the imported domain corresponds to the spec of the created domain.
Also verify that the created domain didn't adopt the one which name is a superstring of it.
