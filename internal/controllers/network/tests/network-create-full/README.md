# Create a network with all the options

## Step 00

Create a network using all available fields, and verify that the observed state corresponds to the spec.

Also validate that the OpenStack resource uses the name from the spec when it is specified.

## TODO

We may want to add in the future a test to check that a network with a dns domain that is not terminated by a dot will not be available
