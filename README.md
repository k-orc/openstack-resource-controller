# ORC: openstack-resource-controller

## Description

[**openstack-resource-controller**][orc], or **ORC**, is a Kubernetes API for
declarative management of OpenStack resources. By fully controlling the order
of OpenStack operations, it allows consumers to easily create, manage, and
reproduce complex deployments. ORC aims to be easily consumed both directly by
users, and by higher level controllers. ORC aims to cover all OpenStack APIs
which can be expressed declaratively.

ORC is based on [Gophercloud][gophercloud], the OpenStack Go SDK.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

ORC heavily uses [CEL validations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#validation-rules) and thus depends on Kubernetes v1.29 or above.

### Installation

To install a released version of ORC, the simplest is probably to use the provided `install.yaml` file:

```
export ORC_RELEASE="https://github.com/k-orc/openstack-resource-controller/releases/latest/download/install.yaml"
kubectl apply --server-side -f $ORC_RELEASE
```

You may later uninstall ORC using the same `install.yaml` file:
```
kubectl delete -f $ORC_RELEASE
```

### Usage

* [Deploy your first OpenStack resource using ORC](https://k-orc.cloud/getting-started/)
